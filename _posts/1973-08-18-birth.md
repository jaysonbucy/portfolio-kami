It was a quite evening on August 18th, 1973 when I was born. I was a large child born with a head full of black hair that promptly fell out, which as it turns out was a sign of things to come. I didn't know my birth parents long, or if they were both present at the time because they put me up for adoption and I was almost immediately adopted by Gene and Darla Bucy of McLoud, Oklahoma.

Being adopted is an adventure. I cannot compare it to other childhoods obviously but I know that the parents I got were the parents that were meant to get me and the ones that have loved me my whole life unconditionally.
