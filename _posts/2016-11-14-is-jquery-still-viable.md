title: Is jQuery still viable?
---

Recently, while learning frontend development, the question was posed, *"If jQuery is so good, why do so many people use vanilla JavaScript?"*

My answer to the question was that while jQuery is robust it is generic by necessity. By this I mean that it has to be able to handle issues that *everyone* will run into. A lot of programmers will need more specific tools for their applications and thus they will revert to vanilla JavaScript. In fact, they can build their own libraries of functions which I am almost positive is how jQuery got started in the first place.

But that does not necessarily mean that jQuery is dead. With new tools like [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) and [React](https://github.com/reactjs) becoming increasingly popular it’s easy to say that you never need to know jQuery. This is blatantly false. With so much of the web still running on jQuery you could spend a career just in maintain existing applications. I would wager there are a lot of companies still developing in it just because that is what they’ve always used (this is a prevailing thought process with many high level management types in my experience).

So do not decide to disregard jQuery because it’s not the new hotness. It isn’t quite old and busted yet.
