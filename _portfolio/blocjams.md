## Explanation
Welcome to Bloc Jams, a digital music player like Spotify that I used to learn frontend web development. I started by building the backbone of the application layout with HTML, add styling and responsiveness using CSS, and implement interactivity with JavaScript.

## Problem
To create a reactive website that can be used to listen to music.

## Solution
I started by building the backbone of the application layout with HTML, added styling and responsiveness using CSS, and implemented interactivity with JavaScript.

## Results
An interesting play coded with HTML, CSS, raw JavaScript and jQuery.

## Conclusion
It was a fun learning experience to work on. There was a lot of copy and paste initially but then I was able to modify that base code into a functional music player. The project was both frustrating and gratifying.
