I am a relic. I started in computing in Junior High School by reading [Micro Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Adventure) books. Jump to the 90's when I finally bought my own Tandy and learned about upgrading RAM and the hard drive as well as tooling around in DOS and Windows 3.11. That lead to me installing Windows 95 and Microsoft Office 95 for individuals and small businesses. Which lead to learning networking and eventually working for a horrible ".com" durning the bubble. Eventually I worked my way up to IT Manager for a small but successful company in Ada, OK.

In 2008 after spending 15 years doing hardware, networking, and security I decided I wanted to break into software so at 35 I enrolled in college for Computer Science. Graduating in 2011 I soon found employment at the [Samuel Roberts Nobel Foundation](https://www.noble.org/) as a maintenance programmer.

Just a year later I started working for [LegalShield](https://www.legalshield.com) as an application analyst and eventually a software engineer. 

Five long years later I joined a brand new team forming at [TBS Factoring](https://www.tbsfactoring.com/) as the sole software engineer creating a Python Flask API to serve both web and mobile applications.

In my spare time I am the husband of the most amazing wife in the world and the father of the best daughter in the world. Oh, and I throw heavy things like trees around for fun sometimes in the Highland Games.
